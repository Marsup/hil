# hil

HIL (Hapi Issues Labels) is a tiny program to add hapijs organization typical labels to your project because it's boring to add it manually...

It does **NOT** delete existing labels, only adds missing ones and fixes colors for existing ones.

# Usage

> hil --token <YOUR_GH_TOKEN> user/repo --dry
> hil --token <YOUR_GH_TOKEN> user/repo

# Note

Considering what it's doing, I don't expect this repository to have much activity, so even if it appears to be dead, it is not :)
